**Explanation:**

*   **UI Components:** The user interface is built using React Native components, styled with React Native Paper for a consistent look and feel.
*   **WorkSession Context:** This acts as the central state management for all work session data, providing functions to add, update, and delete sessions.
*   **AsyncStorage:** All work session data is persistently stored locally on the device using `AsyncStorage`, ensuring data is saved even when the app is closed. There is no external backend or cloud storage involved.
